# CarHiring

The whole project of Car Hiring System is developed using the complete Model-View-Controller pattern.

I have used the 2 patterns to support the MVC which are given below.

1: Observer Pattern
   It is used to connect the main application with the controllers and further used to pass the specific data between views and controllers.
   
2: Factory Pattern
   It is used to create the controllers with full package including model and views. It makes them ready to use and return them.
   
As we used the serialized database in our system, so there are 3 different files which will be generated through system.

1: cars.ser
   It contains all of the serialized Car class objects.

2: customers.ser
   It contains all of the serialized Customer class objects.

3: bookings.ser
   It contains all of the serialized Booking class objects.
